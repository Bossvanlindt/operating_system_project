19.5/20

You passed all the test cases. However, for my_ls, you should omit the hidden files such as .DS
Your output also misses $ at the beginning of each output. This is not a huge problem, but please try to keep align with the sample output style.

Since your implementation showed great effort, I will only deduct 0.5 out of 20.
